PARSING and AST Tree:
	Main function:
		parse code into an array of expressions
		Use the grammer to recursively send the array and return with an AST Tree
			We use a lexer in these steps to return the token of each expression in the array
			We use a pointer in the array to keep track of our reference point
			the recursive section always sends back sub-tree's or null values
		print the ast tree in a pre-order traversal
